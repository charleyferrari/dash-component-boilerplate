# React for Python developers: a primer

## Introduction

If you're a Dash developer, at some point or another you probably have thought about writing your own set of components for Dash.
You might have even taken a peek at some of our source code, or taken the `dash-component-archetype` for a spin. However, if you've
never programmed in JavaScript and/or used React before, you might feel slightly confused. This guide hopes to bridge the gap between
your knowledge of Python and Dash and the languages and frameworks we use to create awesome Dash components!

#### JavaScript

JavaScript is the language of the web - all modern browsers can run it, and most modern web pages use it to make their pages interactive.
It is the de-facto standard of front end development, and has come a long way since it's inception. Today, modern JavaScript features
a rich set of features, designed to create a development experience perfectly suited for the web.

#### React

React is JavaScript library for building user interfaces, written and maintained by Facebook. It has been very popular over the last few
years, mainly because it brings the power of reactive, declarative programming to the world of front end development.
What this means is that it brings power to those programming complex applications on the web, giving them the ability to write highly
interactive web pages in a single language.
It is important to realise that React is just JavaScript. React is not a language on it's own, nor is it any sort of domain-specific framework
that takes years to master. It has a relatively small API to learn, with just a few functions and paradigms to get your head around before
you too can use it to write applications for the web. That being said, all unfamiliar technology will have a learning curve, but with practice
and patience you will master it!
Dash uses React under the hood to render the user interface you see when you load a web page created with Dash. Because React allows you to write
your user interface in encapsulated components that manage their own state, it is easy to split up parts of code for Dash too - at the end of this
tutorial, you will see that Dash components and React components map 1 to 1! For now, it is important to know that Dash components are
mostly just simple wrappers around existing React components. This means the entire React ecosystem is potentially usable in a Dash application!

## Installing everything you need

Let's start by setting up our JavaScript development environment. We will use Node.js, NPM, and our `dash-component-boilerplate` to write our first React
application. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime, which allows you to run JavaScript code outside of the browser. Just like you would run
`python my-code.py` to run Python code in a terminal, you'd run `node my-code.js` to run JavaScript code in a terminal.
Node comes in very handy when developing, even when you intend to run the code in the browser.

#### NPM

With Node we can take advantage of the extensive tooling, provided by NPM, which stands for Node Package Manager. Besides being a package manager
(not unlike `pip` for Python), `npm` also allows you to do other stuff like run scripts and perform tasks, such as creating a project for you by running `npm init`, starting up a project by running `npm start`, or firing custom scripts by running `npm run custom-script`. These scripts are defined in a `package.json` file, which every project that uses `npm` has. The `package.json` file holds your `requirements` and `devRequirements`, which can be installed using `npm install`, the same way `pip` has a `requirements.txt` option you can use in `pip install -r requirements.txt`. `package.json` also holds a `scripts` section, where custom scripts can be defined. It is usually a good idea to check out a new project's `package.json` file, to see what kind of scripts you can run!
If you go to the [dash-component-boilerplate repo](https://github.com/plotly/dash-component-boilerplate), you'll find the instructions to need to set up some React boilerplate code
that helps you quickly get up a React development environment, complete with the scripts we need to finally build our React component for Dash. It also sets up Babel, a transpiler for React so that we can write JSX, and Webpack, a tool
that bundles all of our code into one `bundle.js` file, optimized for speed.

*   To install Node.js, go to [the Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/) to download the latest version.
*   Node.js will automatically install the Node Package Manager `npm` on your machine
*   Verify that node is installed by running: `node -v`
*   Verify that npm is installed by running: `npm -v`
    Now that we have Node.js up and running, go ahead and follow the instructions on the [dash-component-boilerplate repo](https://github.com/plotly/dash-component-boilerplate) to set up your component.

## Quick intro to React

Now, let's go ahead and see what the code for our new React application looks like. Open up your favourite code editor, and open the `src/lib/components/ExampleComponent.react.js` file.
This is our first React component! In React, most of the code you write will reside in some sort of a component. This component is being called in `src/demo/App.js`, which is the top-level component, apptly named `App`. It's job is to basically be the entry point of the app.
Here you will render all other components that you want to be displayed. Try making some changes to both the top-level `App` component, and the `ExampleComponent`, like adding a `<h1>Hello, Dash!</h1>` in between the `<div></div>` tags, and notice how the page hot-reloads on changes!

#### JSX

The `<h1>` and `<div>` tags you see look exactly like HTML tags, however, they are slightly different! These tags are  
 what is called JSX - a syntax extension to JavaScript developed by the React team to have easy, inline, HTML-like markup in your JavaScript components. It is mostly exactly the same as regular HTML. The main difference lies in the naming of attributes - `class` (for appending a CSS class to an HTML tag) is
named `className` here, as to avoid confusion with the actual `class` keyword in JavaScript (yes, JavaScript has classes, just like in Python!). Under the hood, React will call `React.createElement('h1')` for our `<h1>` JSX tags. React doesn't require you to use JSX,
but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside JavaScript.
To learn more about how JSX works and why people use it, read the [documentation here!](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx)

#### Virtual DOM

If we look at the `App` component again, we see that it is `export`ed at the bottom, and if you open up the `src/demo/index.js` file you can see that it's imported there, so it can be used in a call to `ReactDOM.render()`.
This `ReactDOM.render()` method is only called here, and only once. All it does is render our `App` component in a `div` element with the `id` of `root`. React handles all of the rendering of
components internally, using a very smart system called the Virtual DOM. It does this so it can update DOM nodes internally in the most efficient and fast way, meaning we
only have to concentrate on declaring how we want things to look like, and how we want things to behave!

#### Classes

Now, as a Python developer, classes are probably nothing new to you. In the JavaScript community, however, classes are a relatively new addition. They've become available to us
in `ES6`, which stands for EcmaScript 6 - an updated version of JavaScript. React greatly benefits from this enhanced versions of JavaScript, so they decided
to set us up with a transpiler called Babel. Babel is nothing more than a tool that converts (or transpiles) your ES6 (or ES7 and ES8) code into JavaScript
all browsers can understand (even older ones like Internet Explorer!). This allows us to write modern JavaScript - which includes classes - whilest not having to worry (too much) about browser support. Babel comes included with `create-react-app`.
We see here in our `App` component that it is defined as a `class` which `extends` from the `Component` class of React. This provides some methods to us, for example the `render()` method we're using here. `render()` is the method that is called by the _component that is rendering it_. In our case, `render()` is called
by the `ReactDOM.render()` call in `index.js`. Notice how the `<App />` is called in the `ReactDOM.render()` method: our `App` component is used as a JSX tag!

#### Other methods on React.Component

Other methods provided by React are mostly related to component state management. We've got lifecycle hooks like `shouldComponentUpdate` and `componentDidMount` which allow you to better specify when and how a component should update. For these methods, please refer to the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/state-and-lifecycle.html)

## Our very own React component

Now, let's create our very own component. Create a file in `src`, and let's name it `TextInput.js`. In the `TextInput.js` file, let's first import React
and React.Component (the { Component } syntax is a shorthand) the same way as in `App.js` by writing `import React, { Component } from 'react'`.
Next, let's define our component by writing it as a class, which extends React.Component.

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
class TextInput extends Component {
  // here we'll define everything we need our TextInput component to have
}
```

Next, we'll write a `constructor` method on our component. A class constructor in Python is usually defined as `def __init__()` on a class, but in JavaScript
we use the `constructor()` syntax. In the constructor, we call the `super()` method on our component's props (more on props later), and set some `state`.
It will look like this:

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
class TextInput extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      value: 'default'
    }
  }
}
```

`props` are a component's properties. They are passed down from a component's parent, and are available as the `props` attribute. Calling `super()` on `props` in the constructor, makes our props available in the component as `this.props`. The `this` keyword in JavaScript is Python's `self`. We'll show you how to pass down
`props` a bit later on.
We're also defining `this.state` here, which is an `object`. `object`'s in JavaScript are a lot like `dict`'s in Python. They are specified in a notation
called `JSON`, which stands for JavaScript Object Notation. We're setting a `key` on our `state` object, called `value`, to be a string, 'default'.
Next, let's define our `render()` method for our new component. In React, we are declaring UI components, and the `render()` method is the method that is called
when React wants to render those component. React is in charge of keeping track of our components and all of it's state, so it keeps up-to-date. It does this very efficiently, with the use of something called the virtual DOM and React Fiber ([here](https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-internals.html) is a good place to start if you want to learn more about this).
A component's `render` method can return a basic string, for example `return "Hello, World!"`. When this component is used somewhere, it's `render()` method is called and "Hello, World!" will be displayed on our page. Likewise, you can return a React element (specified using JSX) and React will render that element.
There are more things you can do in `render()`, but typically you shouldn't modify state in this method. Read more [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#render)
We'll also go ahead and `export` our component, as the `default`. This means whenever we're trying to `import` something from this file, and we don't specify a name, we'll get the `default` export.

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
class TextInput extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      value: 'default'
    }
  }
  render() {
    return <input />
  }
}

export default TextInput;
```

Now, let's `import` that component and use it in our `App` component! Add the `import TextInput from './TextInput';` line to the top of `App.js`, and somewhere
in the return of our `render()` method, use our newly created `<TextInput />` component.
Tada!
We've got a text input.

However, this input doesn't really do much - it's not connected to anything, nor does it save what you type in. Let's change our `render()` method of `TextInput` to
set the HTML `value` attribute on our `<input />` tag, so it looks like this: `<input value='dash' />`. Save it, and we should now see that the value of our <input> tag
is set to 'dash'! We can also change our value to be that which is defined in our `state` object, so `<input value={this.state.value} />`. The `{}` syntax in JSX means
that we want to write inline JavaScript in our JSX/HTML, so our `this.state.value` statement can be computed. Great! Now our input says 'default'! Unfortunately, our input
is still not very useful, because we can't change our input's value, try as we might.  
 We'll need to write some sort of event handler for this. We can define methods on our component's class, and use those in our `<input/>` tag.

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
class TextInput extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      value: 'default'
    }
  }
  handleInputChange = (e) => {
    // get the value from the DOM node
    const newValue = e.target.value;
    // update the state!
    this.setState({
      value: newValue
    })
  }
  render() {
    return <input value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleInputChange}/>
  }
}

export default TextInput;
```

Here we wrote a method which we set on our HTML's input `onchange` attribute (written as `onChange` in JSX), which will fire
every time an `onchange` event happens on our input. This method has a parameter we named `e` for event, on which certain attributes are
set: `target.value` is what we need. This is how the HTML DOM works - for more information check out [these docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/text).
You might also wonder what the `const` keyword means. In JavaScript, we have a variety of keywords used to define _in which scope a variable lives_. I won't go into the details too deeply, but
the basic idea is that we have a `const` keyword to make a variable constant, i.e. you cannot modify it after creation. You can use the `let` keyword, which is not constant, but is bound to
the scope of the enclosing method, or the `var` keyword, which is also not constant, but, it's scope is broader. In React, it's best to just use `let` for normal variables, and `const` if
you want the variable to be unchangable after definition.
Next, we use a method called `setState()` on our class, provided by `React.Component`. This method will handle updates to our `state` object. Because of how JavaScript works, setting `state`
directly will result in the _component not updating, thus not firing render() again, so we are not able to see our changes!_. This has to do with the updating of the internal state array - because
it is not a new object (as happens in `setState()`, it is not recognized as new) [here's a good article on the subject.](https://daveceddia.com/why-not-modify-react-state-directly/)
See how this now allows you to type in our input component? We can also display our state, by writing our `render()` method something like:

```
render() {
  return <div>
    <input value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleInputChange} />
    <p>{this.state.value}</p> // here we're displaying our state
  </div>
}
```

Notice that we're not allowed to return multiple elements from `render()`, but an element with children is totally fine.
We can also pass along properties to our components, via the before mentioned `props`. This works the same as assigning attributes on a component, as we'll demonstrate by adding a `label` prop to our `TextInput` component!
Let's edit our call to `<TextInput />` in `App.js` to say `<TextInput label='dash-input' />`. This means we now have a `prop` called `label` available on our `TextInput` component!
In `TextInput`, we can reference this via `this.props`. Let's extend our `render()` method further so it renders our `label` prop:

```
render() {
  return <div>
    <label>{this.props.label}</label>
    <input value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleInputChange} />
    <p>{this.state.value}</p>
  </div>
}
```

Props always flow down, but you can set a method as a prop too, so that a child can call a method of a parent. For more information, please refer to the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
These are just the basics of React, if you want to know more, the [React docs](https://reactjs.org/docs) are a great place to start!

## Using your React components in Dash

We can use most, if not all, components build in React in Dash! Dash uses React under the hood, specifically in the `dash-renderer`. The `dash-renderer` is basically just a React app, that renders the
layout defined in your Dash app as `app.layout`! It is also responsible for assigning the callbacks you write in Dash to the proper components, and keeping everything up-to-date. The `App` component
we have been working with so far can simply be thought of as `dash-renderer`!
There are, of course, some steps you must take for your component to work nicely with Dash. The `props` you want to be available in Dash, should be specified as `propTypes` on the React component, so that the
Dash Component Archetype (note: this here will need some clarification) can read them and convert them to React. In our example, we can easily do this by changing our code like so:

```
// other imports
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
class TextInput extends Component {
  // class definition here
}
TextInput.propTypes = {
  /**
  * This comment will also get parsed by Dash,
  * so that it is available in help(component.TextInput)
  **/
  label: PropTypes.string
}
```

Because we specified what props our component will recieve, Dash is able to read this and make those props available in Dash!
This means we could use our component in Dash:

```
app.layout = html.Div[
  ourCustomComponent.TextInput(label='great!')
]
```

We also have a special prop available called `setProps`. This is Dash's way of keeping state _within Dash_ (so not internally in our React component). You can think of it
as `setState()`, but for Dash. In your React component, you can thus call `this.props.setProps` (if it is set) _instead_ of `this.setState()`, and the state will be handled
in Dash instead of in React! We can re-write our `TextInput` component as follows:

```
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
class TextInput extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  handleInputChange = (e) => {
    // get the value from the DOM node
    const newValue = e.target.value;
    // update the props!
    this.props.setProps({
      value: newValue
    })
  }
  render() {
    return <input value={this.props.value} onChange={this.handleInputChange}/mg
    >
  }
}
TextInput.propTypes = {
  /**
  * This comment will also get parsed by Dash,
  * so that it is available in help(component.TextInput)
  **/
  label: PropTypes.string,
  /**
  * The value of the text input (coming from Dash)
  **/
  value: PropTypes.string,
  /**
  * Dash-provided callback for keeping state
  **/
  setProps: PropTypes.function
}

export default TextInput;
```

Note that if you run this example above in the demo provided by `dash-component-boilerplate`, `setProps` is defined in `demo/App.js`. In Dash however, `setProps` will be injected in our component by Dash, when it passes it to `dash-renderer`. The `setProps` method _lifts up_ the state from being handled _in the React component itself_ (via `setState`) to being handled _from within your Dash application_. This means that if we use `setProps` in our React component, the
values passed into `setProps` are also being updated inside Dash. This is very useful if you want users of your component to be able to change the props of your component from within Dash.

When developing, we're usually not running our Dash application - we're running our component somewhere else, in our case, we're running it in the demo app in `dash-component-boilerplate`, `src/demo/App.js`.

```
import React, {Component} from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import * as R from 'ramda';
import {ExampleComponent} from '../lib';
class App extends Component {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.state = {
            value: ''
        }
        this.setProps = this.setProps.bind(this);
    }
    setProps(newProps) {
        this.setState(newProps);
    }
    render() {
        return (
            <div>
              <TextInput
                label="dash-input"
                value={this.state.value}
                setProps={this.setProps}
              />
            </div>
        )
    }
}
export default App;
```

We pass `setProps` here to our component so that it can use it (this is what is called "prop drilling" - passing props around to allow children components to use them). We also set the `value` of our `TextInput` component to be equal to `this.state.value`.
If all is well, and you're happy with your component, the next step is building our component for Dash, and using it in an actual Dash app. Luckily, the `dash-component-boilerplate` project provides the scripts for us that we need to build our component.
Please check out the [dash-component-boilerplate repo](https://github.com/plotly/dash-component-boilerplate) again, and follow the steps required for building.
